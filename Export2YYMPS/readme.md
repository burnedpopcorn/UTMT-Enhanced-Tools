# Export2YYMPS

The Only Decompiling Script that Exports as a YYMPS Package
(Uses Ultimate_GMS2_Decompiler as a Base)

Original Decompiler by loypoll

YYMPS Exporting Functionality by me

### Export2YYMPS Features:
- Export Individual and Seperate Assets into a YYMPS Package
    - Or Export Whole Asset Sections into YYMPS Package

- Ability to Change the YYMPS Name, ID, and Version

### CURRENT ISSUES
- Adding TileSets/Backgrounds causes generated YYMPS package to fail loading

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Download ```Export2YYMPS_UA.csx``` for the UnderAnalyzer Version of the Script
>
> UTMT (and UTMTCE) Versions are planned, but have not been made yet
