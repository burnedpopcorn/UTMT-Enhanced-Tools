# UnderTaleModTool Enhanced Tools
A Collection of Modified Scripts that aim to Enhance the output of the older Scripts they were built off of
> All of these have been Modified by me to fix Issues or to Enhance them even further

Included are:

- [(NEW) GameMaker Studio 2 Decompiler](https://github.com/burnedpopcorn/UTMT-Enhanced-Tools/tree/main/Ultimate_GMS2_Decompiler)

(UnderAnalyzer, UTMT, AND UTMTCE Versions are Available)
- [GameMaker Studio 1 Decompiler](https://github.com/burnedpopcorn/UTMT-Enhanced-Tools/tree/main/Export2GMS1FIXED)

(UnderAnalyzer, UTMT, AND UTMTCE Versions are Available)
- [Better ExportAssetsOrder Script](https://github.com/burnedpopcorn/UTMT-Enhanced-Tools/tree/main/BetterExportAssetsOrder)

(Works on both UTMT and UnderAnalyzer)

### OLD TOOLS (Not Included in the Decomp Pack):

These are unnecessary, as the New GMS2 Decompiler has made these obsolete
- [DEPRECATED - GameMaker Studio 2 Decompiler](https://github.com/burnedpopcorn/UTMT-Enhanced-Tools/blob/main/GMS2_Decompiler_FIXED)
- [DEPRECATED - Better ExportGMS2Enums Script](https://github.com/burnedpopcorn/UTMT-Enhanced-Tools/tree/main/BetterExportGMS2Enums)
