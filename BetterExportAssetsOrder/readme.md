# BetterExportAssetsOrder

This is an Improved version of ExportAssetsOrder, which was Originally Made by Grossley and colinator27 for use in official UndertaleModTool Releases

Which was improved by me, burnedpopcorn180

> This Script Should work for both UTMT and UnderAnalyzer (GUI), although UnderAnalyzer has yet to be tested

BetterExportAssetsOrder Changes:
- Made output text file more readable
  - As in, it provides info on how many assets are available in the project to list and number
  - It then lists assets in order in their respective categories
  - Listed assets also now are numbered in the text log
  - Category Seperation is Cleaner and more Noticable
  - And if a Category has no assets, it will mention that none have been found for it
- Changed Name of Log Text File (because I can)
