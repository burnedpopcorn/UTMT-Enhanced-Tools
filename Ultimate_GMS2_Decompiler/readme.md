# Ultimate_GMS2_Decompiler_UA

The Ultimate GMS2 Decompiler!
(Uses GMS2_Decompiler_FIXED as a Base)

Original Script by loypoll

Major Improvements and Fixes by me

### Ultimate_GMS2_Decompiler_UA Features:
- Enum Declarations are Automatically Extracted and added into the Project, no further action is required
- Asset_Order, a Note within the Project, is available for those that want an absolute PERFECT Decompilation, which can be used to find an Asset's ID, so you can replace any instance of it with the Asset Name

These Changes incorperate both
BetterExportGMS2Enums.csx and BetterExportAssetsOrder.csx
making both obsolete

### GMS2_Decompiler_FIXED Changes:
- Start-up Greetings and Credits Pop-Up
- Sprites and TileSets that have no associated image attached to them no longer throw an exception, and will still allow decompilation to finish
- Lists any encountered null sprite/tileset in the error text log
