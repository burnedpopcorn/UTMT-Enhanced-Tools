# GMS2_Decompiler_FIXED

This is an improved version of loypoll's original GMS2 Decompiler Script
> This is based off of loypoll's UnderAnalyzer Decompiler

GMS2_Decompiler_FIXED Changes:
- Start-up Greetings and Credits Pop-Up
- Sprites and TileSets that have no associated image attached to them no longer throw an exception, and will still allow decompilation to finish
- Lists any encountered null sprite/tileset in the error text log

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Use in UTMT, download ```GMS2_Decompiler_FIXED_UTMT.csx```
>
> For Use in UnderAnalyzer, download ```GMS2_Decompiler_FIXED_UA.csx```
