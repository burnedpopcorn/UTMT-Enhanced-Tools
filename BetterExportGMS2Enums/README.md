## BetterExportGMS2Enums
Improved by burnedpopcorn

I actually don't know who made this original file
But it needed Improvements, since it could only decompile the Unknown Enums
	
also, this is a UnderAnalyzer only Script, because only UnderAnaylzer uses Enums like Unknown Enums
	
 Changes:
- Added ability to detect and add ```e__VW``` and ```e__BG``` Enums (Usually used for GMS1 Compatiablity Scripts)
- Notify user to turn off Create Enum Declarations in Settings (THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR DECOMPILATIONS)
- Removed ability to report Decompiling Errors, because it often didn't mean anything, and just flooded your screen with useless errors

- (NEW) Added ability to detect and add ```e__YYM``` and ```e__YYMKIND``` Enums (for GMS1 Compatiablity Scripts)
- (NEW) Output File now mentions where Enum Declarations for GMS1 Compatiablity Scripts usually go

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Download ```BetterExportGMS2Enums.csx``` for the Script
		
> If there are more Enums that I missed, please dm me on Discord (burnedpopcorn180)
