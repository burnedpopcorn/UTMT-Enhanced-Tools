# GMFolder_Cloner

GMFolder_Cloner is a Python (3.12) Script that Copies the Internal GameMaker Folders from an already Organized GMS2 Project (Like OpenTower)
and Clones it to another GMS2 Project (your Decompilation)

This will immensely aid in organizing a Decompilation, as it organizes any assets that both projects have
(Note that it does NOT organize any assets that aren't shared between them, so the rest will be up to you)
